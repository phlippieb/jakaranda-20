# Project plan: Jakaranda Wynproegulde Proegids

The goal of this project is to create a cross-platform mobile application for members of the Jakaranda Wynproegulde. The app will act as a guide for wine tastings, serving two purposes: guiding members through a thorough wine tasting experience, and automatically scoring wines based on their evaluations, with the option for members to tweak the scores.

The guild uses their own version of a 20-point scoring system, so the scoring mechanism will be somewhat different from other known systems. It will be based on the WSET evaluation system, with certain criteria contributing to their 20-point score.

## Non-functionals

- Usable on iOS and Android devices
- Lightweight
- Support Afrikaans terminology
- Accessible in terms of aided readability (the user group's mean age is relatively high)
- Local-only — no backend, to eliminate running costs

## Implementation plan

The scoring system will require some user testing and stakeholder collaboration to finalise, so the initial implementation will focus on this. Subsequent milestones will add more features as per the guild's requirements. 

1. Milestone 1: just a tasting and scoring guide for evaluating a single wine at a time
2. Milestone 2: Add a history of previous evaluations
3. Subsequent milestones: may add social features catering for wine tasting events, cloud data persistence, etc
